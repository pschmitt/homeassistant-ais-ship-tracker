# Changelog

## 1.4.7
* [Feature] Persist the complete `sensor.last_passing_ship` payload in the add-on data directory and restore it after Home Assistant restarts.

## 1.4.6
* [Fix] Enhanced reconnection logic after a couple of recent AISStream outages. The app should now gracefully reconnect when the service comes back up. 
* [Fix] Fixed accuracy of outage status for sensor.ais_connection_status entity

## 1.4.5
* [Feature] The connectivity status entity (sensor.ais_connection_status) is now integrated with Buttermilkgreen uptime monitor API (https://aisuptime.buttermilkgreen.fyi/). This can be disabled or you can add a custom URL if you are self hosting the uptime monitor. If disabled, the entity will show connectivity status relative to your connection to the AISStream websocket. Note: If you were using the specific responses sent by the API before for any automations, these will be different when using the Uptime API connection. See docs for responses. 

## 1.4.0
* [Feature] Filter ships by MMSI. Enter one or many MMSI numbers (comma separated) into the filter field in the config to only show those ships. 

## 1.3.0
* [Feature] Additional attributes added. Note these are all part of ShipStaticData and update every ~6 minutes:
  * ship_length: The total physical length of the vessel in metres
  * imo_number: The unique, permanent 7-digit identifier assigned to the hull
  * call_sign: The vessel's unique alphanumeric maritime radio call sign
  * vessel_type: The categorisation of the ship, such as "Cargo Ship", "Pleasure Craft", or "Search and Rescue".
  * destination: The intended port or location the vessel is sailing towards. Note this is manually updated by crew so may be inaccurate
  * eta: The projected arrival time at the destination, formatted as DD/MM HH:MM UTC. Note this is manually updated by crew so may be inaccurate
* [Feature] Added documentation tab to the add-on
* [Fix] Stale ships are now reliably removed in general and on restart
* [Fix] Config changes are properly applied on restart

  * Ship entities that no longer exist in the bounding box will have the GPS co-ordinates cleared after 30 minutes of no updates (default)
  * Icons show the status of each ship. See documentation.
  * [Config] "Ship Timeout" - how long before ships that stop reporting are cleared from the map
